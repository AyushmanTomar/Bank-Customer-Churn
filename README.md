# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`Bank_Customer_Churn.ipynb`) that demonstrates the process of training a neural network model to predict bank customer churn.

## Overview

Customer churn prediction is critical for banks to retain their customers and understand the factors that lead to customer attrition. This project utilizes a neural network model built with TensorFlow and Keras to predict the likelihood of a customer leaving the bank.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various features such as customer demographics, account details, and transaction history. The target variable is a binary indicator of whether the customer has churned.

## Model

The neural network model consists of multiple dense layers with sigmoid activation functions. The model is trained using a binary cross-entropy loss function and optimized using the Adam optimizer.

## Usage

To run the notebook:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the repository directory and launch Jupyter Notebook.
4. Open the `Bank_Customer_Churn.ipynb` notebook and run the cells.
